Skipped the web GUI, just ran the Gcode directly

M503
...
Recv: echo:; Maximum feedrates (units/s):
Recv: echo:  M203 X300.00 Y300.00 Z4.00 E25.00  <- set to 25 by default

M203 E60   <- setting to 50 MAX

M503  <- save
...
Recv: echo:; Maximum feedrates (units/s):
Recv: echo:  M203 X300.00 Y300.00 Z4.00 E60.00  <- max is now 60

M500 to save to flash!  Klipper would use SAVE_CONFIG I think

Printed with 40mm/s, saw little improvement over 25.
